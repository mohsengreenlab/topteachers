Keep the current design, layout, copy tone, Captcha, and PostgreSQL functionality.
Now make ONLY the following modifications:

Form updates

Add a “Phone Number” field with a country selector and dial code:

Label text must be exactly “Phone Number” (do not include “(optional)”).

Field remains optional (no change to validation requirements).

Country dropdown must include all countries with name, flag, and dial code (e.g., “🇩🇪 Germany (+49)”).

Store country_code (e.g., +49) and phone in PostgreSQL with the existing contact submission.

Keep client-side validation; if provided, ensure plausible number format.

Update the DB schema/migration and server handler to accept and persist these fields (both nullable).

You may use a lightweight solution (e.g., an international telephone input with full country data) or an ISO-based dataset; ensure all countries are present.

Header / Contact

Replace any “Call us” phone number with a Telegram contact link:

Use: https://t.me/topteachersonline

Make it a prominent contact option (icon OK), and open in a new tab.

Stats & copy changes (update every occurrence)

Expert Tutors → 75+

Happy Students → 185+ (appears in two places; update both)

Satisfaction Rate → 91%

Hero/CTA text “Join 10,000+ Happy Learners” → “Join 185+ Happy Learners”

Footer updates

Remove the bottom-of-page “Learn More About Us” button entirely.

Remove the text “Made with ❤️ for better learning” from the footer.

Change footer year 2024 → 2025 (keep any ©/company text intact).

Constraints & notes

Do not add new pages or routes; still a single-page app.

Preserve all existing styles, layout, animations, Captcha, and submission flow.

If stats/counters are defined in a config/constants file, update there to keep all instances in sync.

Provide the minimal PostgreSQL migration for the new fields:

country_code VARCHAR(8) NULL

phone VARCHAR(32) NULL

(Optionally include country_iso2 CHAR(2) NULL if your country dataset exposes it.)

Deliverables

Updated front-end (HTML/CSS/JS) reflecting the items above.

Updated back-end handler and PostgreSQL migration for country_code and phone.

Brief note in README or code comments summarizing what changed and where.
